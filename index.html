        <h1>The tail of the SQRL band</h1>

        <br>
        
<p>Now, Barvis doesnt like to play his trumpet alone. Can we find him some bandmates?</p>
<br>
<p>Squirrel down and we'll see!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Is that Zane on the xylo? it sure looks like it. Why dont we bring him up to Barvis?</p>

<br>
<br>
<br><p>Well, we have the trumpet and the xylophone covered.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>I suppose we could use a turtle on the vocals to round out the crew. Turkey The Tortoise, is that you?</p>
